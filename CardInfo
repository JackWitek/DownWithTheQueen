Card Code Structure:

All Cards have base attributes:
a) cardName, the name of the card
b) cardType: 
		1) Action, a move a single player initiates
		2) Equipment, a tool which is attached to the player
		3) Global, a move which affects all players
		
To create a new card simply create a new Java class and extend the card class. 
Implement the card methods as (class).activate().
